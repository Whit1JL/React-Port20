# React-Port20

## Description
Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

My task was to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. This is an overview of what I have learned during my time in the bootcamp.
